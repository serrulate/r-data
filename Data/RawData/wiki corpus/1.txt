In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that does not change its direction when that linear transformation is applied to it. In other words, if v is a vector that is not the zero vector, then it is an eigenvector of a linear transformation T if T(v) is a scalar multiple of v. This condition can be written as the equation T(\mathbf{v}) = \lambda \mathbf{v}, where Î» is a scalar known as the eigenvalue or characteristic value associated with the eigenvector v. If the linear transformation T is expressed as a square matrix A, then the equation can be expressed as the matrix multiplication A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}, where v is a column vector. There is a correspondence between n by n square matrices and linear transformations from an n-dimensional vector space to itself. For this reason, it is equivalent to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors using either the language of matrices or the language of linear transformations.[1][2] Geometrically, an eigenvector corresponding to a real, nonzero eigenvalue points in a direction that is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed.[3]
